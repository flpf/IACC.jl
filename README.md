Modified Inter-Aural Cross Correlation Coefficient (IACC) calculation. 

This is based on the room-acoustics version of the IACC but is extended 
to calculate the temporal development of the IACC for stereo recordings 
of musical instruments. 

It can be used to approximate the apparent source width of a musical 
instrument recorded with a dummy-head (or two microphones) in the near-field.

The IACC is a measure for the perceived "spaciousness" of a musical instrument.

This version is in alpha state. -> It works but is not generic.
